# Bot Clown

As the great Chinese philosopher San Hui Sun said in 739 BC
>As my good friend San Hui Win said, literally EVERY person's dream on earth is to go to Telegram at any moment to get a random joke from a 2002-year Russian web-site.

This bot solves this problem.
With the help of the latest gen technologies

## Features
- Dynamic parse joke from web-site with jokes. No more repeats jokes never.
- No clogging of the chat with a large number of messages. With using InlineKeyboard.
- Three category jokes(maybe more in future(anyone sure want most three? it's so many!))
